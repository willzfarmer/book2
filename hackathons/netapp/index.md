# NetApp

Brian McKean from NetApp presented to the class a data analysis problem he'd
like to get some help on.

# Overview

Listen to his presentation carefully. Write down the answers to the following
questions to show your team's understanding of the basics of the problem.

## What is the problem?

> What errors are there with the data acquisition process?

## Why is the problem important?

> We need to verify the data integrity.

## What dataset has been made available?

| Date | System Serial | Controller | Obs. Time | Base Time | Delta | Release | FW | SW |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## What specific questions are being raised?

1. > Are things getting better over time?
2. > What percent of data is "good"?
3. > Is the "good" data random?

# Q/A session

We will run a Q/A session. Before the session, compile a list of questions you
want to ask. Then, teams will take turn to ask Brian follow up questions.
Each team gets to ask one question each time. Write down the questions your team
wanted to ask and the answers you received. If another team happens to ask the
same question, simply write down the answer you heard.

## Is there any more data? (More columns?)

> No, those are the only columns.

This implies that the problem is actually looking at the issues with the data
collection process, not the write-problem.

## What is the ideal behavior?

> Ideally, there is one entry that spans a day from each system once per day.
